# Why run from command line? #

When running on the command line the program works just like it does when run normally, but in addition all problems are printed on the command line. This is useful when trying to solve a problem.


# Windows #
  1. Click the "Start" button.
  1. Click in the search field.
  1. Type **cmd** and press enter.
  1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded PQLibre by using the **cd** command, for example **cd Downloads**
  1. Run the program: **java -jar pqlibre0.8.3-winXX.jar** (replace XX with the version you are using, either 32 or 64).
  1. If you get the message "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.", try using this command: **"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -jar pqlibre0.8.3-winXX.jar** (replace XX with the version you are using, either 32 or 64).

# Linux #
  1. Open a terminal window, for example **xterm**.
  1. Navigate to the directory where the pqlibre jar file is stored, for example **cd ~/jarfiles**
  1. Run the program: **java -jar pqlibre0.8.3-linuxXX.jar** ( replace XX with the version you are using, either 32 or 64).
