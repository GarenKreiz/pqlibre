# Troubleshooting #
  * Q: When I double-click the file I don't get a login dialog, I get a list of files.
> > A: Try right-clicking on the file, select open-with and specify Java. If you are using Windows you might want to try running [JarFIX](http://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/)  instead.

  * Q: When I double-click the file nothing happens.
> > A: You don't have Java installed or you have the wrong version of the file. This often happens if you are running 32-bit Java on 64-bit Windows, or 64-bit Java on 32-bit Windows. Try downloading the other version than the one you have. If that doesn't work, try running [JarFIX](http://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/). If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling Java.

  * Q: The program crashed or did something else unexpected.
> > A: There are still bugs. Please help us help you by submitting a bug report using the ["Issues"](http://code.google.com/p/pqlibre/issues/list) link, above.

  * Q: How can I run PQLibre from the command line?
> > A: By following [this tutorial](RunningCommandLine.md).
