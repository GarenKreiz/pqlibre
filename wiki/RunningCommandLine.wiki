#summary How to run PQLibre from the command line

= Why run from command line? =

When running on the command line the program works just like it does when run normally, but in addition all problems are printed on the command line. This is useful when trying to solve a problem.


= Windows =
  # Click the "Start" button.
  # Click in the search field.
  # Type "`cmd`"  (without the quotes) and press enter.
  # Navigate to the folder where you downloaded PQLibre, for example "`cd Downloads`" (without the quotes).
  # Run the program: "`java -jar pqlibre0.8.1-winXX.jar`" (without the quotes, replace XX with the version you are using, either 32 or 64).
  # If you get the message "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.", try using this command: "`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -jar pqlibre0.8.1-winXX.jar`" 

= Linux =
  # Open a terminal window, for example *xterm*.
  # Navigate to the directory where the pqlibre jar file is stored, for example "`cd ~/jarfiles`" (without the quotes).
  # Run the program: "`java -jar pqlibre0.8.1-linuxXX.jar`" (without the quotes, replace XX with the version you are using, either 32 or 64).
